# Cantina do IFAL
In this project, the idea was to simulate an app for the IFAL canteen. The users are able to buy food from the canteen. The canteen employee can register, edit and delete the products. The stock must store product information, such code, description, purchase price, sales price, etc. The app is able to show a summary of items and their available quantities sorted by description or available quantity, user discretion. The app always show summary of items with low quantity in stock (below 50 items). Each sale can have several items. The app should show a profit and loss summary.

# Difficulties
 - We were unable to do the profit and loss summaries part <br>
 
 # Step by step
 - Create a database
 - Enter the ConnectionFactory class and change the database name to the created db
 - Change the username and password for those registered on the computer
 - Default is root and "", which is what is already in the class
 - After that, just import the .sql file into the sql folder in the sgbd
 - And run the Main class
